My role spanned from creating initial whitebox models through to detailed stock and custom clothing assets (some built in Marvelous Designer). I led the visualisation process, iterating on design options and producing high-quality renders for presentations and final design approval. This included material development, lighting, and post-production, supported by colleagues across the team.</p>"
